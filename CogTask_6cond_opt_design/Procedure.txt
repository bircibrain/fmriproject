1. run optimize.sh
	1.1 get a seed
	1.2 generate N random sequences
	1.3 create timing files from binary files
	1.4 calculate efficiency for each of the timing files
	1.5 use efficiency parser to parse the output from 1.4
2. run findLowest.py on the results file (results.txt) to find the lowest stim and contrast efficiency values with the indeces of the iterations in which they occur
